added title to page

added header section to specify organization of the website.

styles.css sheet it is important that the classes are in order as listed on the index.html file. Maintaining a clean cose will be substaintial if any future changes need to be made or if there needs to be any debugging. It will be easier to find errors that way. 

Header is a default style element so I didn't need multiple classes within it on the style sheet. I also added a nav class which is also a default style. 

on line 26 of the HTML file, I added a semantic HTML element because that is the main part of the page. I also consolidated all of the classes on my styles.css sheet to service-name so there are not redundent versions of the same code listed that function the same way. 

on line 31,38, 45,56, 63,70 I added an alt text to allow accessability to users with visual impairments and if the page is not loading, the browser will give a description of what the photo is. 

on line 52, I added a semantic element to define the side of the page on the browser, which includes the benefits of the social media marketing page. I also made changes to the classes to benefit and benefits** to consolidate the style changes and remove redundent code to make it more organized. 

I added a footer at the bottom, there was a div there before.
